title: Static View
description: Tutorial > Static View
---

In the [first part](./introduction) we went through introduction to IMA.js and initialized our first
application using `create-ima-app` command. In the second part of the tutorial
we'll actually do some coding and prepare basic Views for our guest book application.

## View Component

Open up the `app/page/home/HomeView.jsx` file in your code editor. You will see a
single ES2015 class named `HomeView`, extending the `AbstractComponent` class
(which in turn extends the
[`React.Component`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html)
class). You can read more about components and views in the [documentation](../basic-features/views-and-components.md).

Now let's replace the contents of the file with a blank view:

```jsx
import { PageContext, AbstractComponent } from '@ima/react-page-renderer';
import React from 'react';

export default class HomeView extends AbstractComponent {
  static get contextType() {
    return PageContext;
  }

  render() {
    return null;
  }
}
```

The `HomeView` class defines the `render()` method. Notice that our current
`HomeView` class does not have the `constructor()` method, as the default
one provided by the `AbstractComponent` class will do in this case.

The `constructor()` is the class constructor (an object initializer, if you
will) that sets the component's initial properties (`props`) and context. The
`props` object represents the properties set on our view component by the
code using it (_the properties are set using the element attributes in JSX,
you can find our more about this
[here](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html)_). The
context is an object representing the "globals" for the React components in
the application. IMA.js uses the context to pass view utils to components,
you can find out more about it
[here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html).

There's also static getter `contextType()` which returns `PageContext`, that
by default provides the component access to global `$Utils` object in the component context.
This object is very useful as we can bind custom helper methods to it in the
`bind.js`file with the help of Object Container. But we'll talk about this a bit more
[later in this tutorial](./fetching-data.md#dependency-injection)

The `render()` method creates and returns a React element that represents the
view in the UI. Our `render()` method returns `null` because our component does
not have a UI yet.

Now that we know our way around our component, let's replace the contents of
the `render()` method with the following code:

```jsx
return <div className="l-home container">Hello {'World'}!</div>;
```

The "HTML" code you see is actually an XML markup with JavaScript expressions
embedded within curly braces. This markup is processed automatically by Babel's
JSX transformer into ordinary JavaScript expressions creating React elements
(React's virtual DOM allowing rendering at both the client and the server side).
This combination of JavaScript and XML is commonly referred to as JSX and you
can find out more about it
[here](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).

The `render()` method must always return a React element (or a similar plain
object, or `null`), so it can be properly rendered at both the client and
server. Never attempt to create an actual DOM element in your view - your
application will most likely break! This is because your code is run at the
server first, where no DOM is available, and polyfilling it, while possible,
would introduce a large overhead. Additionally, since the UI is rendered using
React which modifies the DOM at the client side, any changes to the DOM you would
manage to make would likely be lost with the next update of the page's UI.

If everything went well you should see the following page when you refresh your browser:

### Guestbook form & SMACSS

Let's modify the return value of the `render` method to look like this:

```jsx
return (
      <div className="l-home container">
        <h1>Guestbook</h1>

        <div className="posting-form card">
          <form action="" method="post">
            <h5 className="card-header">Add a post</h5>
            <div className="card-body">
              <div className="form-group">
                <label htmlFor="postForm-name">Name:</label>
                <input
                  id="postForm-name"
                  className="form-control"
                  type="text"
                  name="author"
                  placeholder="Your name"
                />
              </div>
              <div className="form-group">
                <label htmlFor="postForm-content">Post:</label>
                <textarea
                  id="postForm-content"
                  className="form-control"
                  name="content"
                  placeholder="What would you like to tell us?"
                />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div className="card-footer">
              <button type="submit" className="btn btn btn-outline-primary">
                Submit
                <div className="ripple-wrapper" />
              </button>
            </div>
          </form>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <div className="posts">
          <h2>Posts</h2>
          <div className="post card card-default">
            <div className="card-body">Never mistake motion for action.</div>
            <div className="post-author card-footer">Ernest Hemingway</div>
          </div>
          <div className="post card card-default">
            <div className="card-body">
              Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.
            </div>
            <div className="post-author card-footer">Henry Ford</div>
          </div>
          <div className="post card card-default">
            <div className="card-body">
              We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but
              a habit.
            </div>
            <div className="post-author card-footer">Aristotle</div>
          </div>
          <div className="post card card-default">
            <div className="card-body">
              Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.
            </div>
            <div className="post-author card-footer">Albert Einstein</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
```

Whoa, that's a lot of code! But don't worry, it's just a form we'll use to
write new posts and some example posts. Notice the CSS class we put on the root
element though, `l-home`. It is considered a good practice to add such a CSS
class on the root element of every React component and/or controller view. The
CSS class name should be the slugified version of the React component's /
controller's name, for example `MyAwesomeComponent` would become
`my-awesome-component`. Additionally, it is recommended to prefix the
controller's name with `l-` (think "layout"), leading to `l-home` for our
`Home` controller's view.

The main point of this practice is that it enables easy scoping of CSS rules
that should affect only the contents of the component and not the rest of the
page, thus reducing the amount of possible conflicts in CSS declarations.

The `l-` prefix used in the case of controller views is added to prevent
possible collisions with components that might share the same name, and to
allow easy inclusion of single page-specific overrides for the UI of your
components that will not affect the rest of the pages in your application.

In general, it is recommended to organize your CSS code according to the
[SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) recommendation (Scalable and Modular Architecture
for CSS). Feel free to read through the page if you are not familiar with
SMACSS yet, it won't take you long.

### Styling our form

So let's make our guestbook look a little better. To achieve this, we'll
use the Bootstrap library. To make things simple,
we will just use the CDN-hosted CSS file, since we don't need any of Bootstrap's JS components in our example anyway.

In a real application, we strongly recommend you manage these dependencies yourself (for example through npm packages),
and consider using a custom build that includes only the necessary CSS/JS.
<!-- *this is* -->

First we need to include a few files to our page. Open the document component
`app/component/document/DocumentView.jsx` (this is the UI component that renders the basic structure of the HTML document. You'll find more details about it in the [Rendering the whole document](#rendering-the-whole-document) section of this chapter).
Insert the following code before the `<link rel="stylesheet" ...` line to include
the Bootstrap CSS library:

```xml
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>
```

This will save us a lot of effort with styling our UI.

#### Defining custom styles

Let's write some CSS to make our guestbook look even better. Open the
`app/assets/less/setting.less` file and add the following code to set up our
layout configuration:

```scss
@post-author-alignment: right;
```

Next open the `app/assets/less/base.less` file and add the following code below the existing one:

```scss
form {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

Now let's open the the `app/page/home/homeView.less` file and replace the
contents with the following code:

```scss
.l-home {
    margin-top: 2rem;

    .post-author {
        text-align: @post-author-alignment;
        font-style: italic;
        font-size: 85%;
    }

    .card {
        margin-bottom: 2rem;
    }
}
```

Go ahead and check the results in the browser. It sure does look a little
better (you may have to reload the page, or event restart the dev server
by hitting `Ctrl+C` and then re-running the `npm run dev` command if your
browser cannot access the newly installed resources). In the end of this section
you should see something like this when you refresh your page.

### Rendering the whole document

As you may have noticed, we didn't specify any `<html>` or `<body>` element in
our controller view, and yet the page rendered in the browser has them. So how
did this little piece of magic happen?

As you may recall from the beginning of this tutorial, the `app/component`
directory contains components that are used in the application UI. There is one
special component - the document component
(`app/component/document/DocumentView.jsx`). The document component handles
rendering the basic structure of the HTML document like the `<html>` and
`<body>` elements.

Finally, the document component must render three elements, `<div id="page">`,
`<script id="revivalSettings">` and `<script id="scripts">`.

 - `#page` - is a place where current view is rendered.
 - `#revivalSettings` - contains JavaScript code used to initialize the environment for your application at the client side.
 - `#scripts` - contains the JavaScript logic of your application.

The order is important as this will allow your users
to see the whole of the page content before the application is fully loaded in
the browser (remember, the content is first rendered at the server side).

The one thing the document component does not render and is handled by IMA.js
itself is the `<!doctype html>` doctype at the beginning of the rendered page -
this is due to the limitations of the React library, but you don't need to
concern yourself with this very much.

Note that the document component is only used at the server-side, as the
application only updates the contents of the `#page` element at the
client-side (and the page title and meta tags through the meta-manager, which
will not be covered by this tutorial, but you can learn more about its interface
in the API [/api/meta/meta-meta-manager](../api/classes/ima_core.MetaManager.md)).

For more information about `DocumentView` and whole rendering process of IMA.js
application, [take a look at the documentation](../basic-features/rendering-process.md).

### Notes on ES2015 modules and IMA.js namespaces

Starting with version 15 of IMA.js namespaces were deprecated in favor of ES2015
modules. Mainly because ES modules are now more widespread and have better support
in many IDEs thus don't pose such a problem when it comes to refactoring.

Previously almost all of the JavaScript files in your IMA.js application included
a snippet of code like this one near the beginning:

```javascript
import ns from 'ima/namespace';

ns.namespace('app.foo.bar');
```

and ended with a line of code like this one:

```javascript
ns.app.foo.bar.Baz = Baz;
```

The first snippet imports the object that represents the root namespace for the
classes, constants and values in the application, and then ensures that the
namespace to which the class / constant / value will be bound exists by calling
`ns.namespace('namespace name goes here')`. The second snippet binds the class,
constant or value created in the file to the namespace.

**If you're using version 15 and above** you can safely remove deprecated namespaces
and replace them with ES2015 [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
and [`export`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export).
