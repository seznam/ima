import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In [previous part](./fetching-data) we created our classes and services to handle data fetching from server.
We also learned something about the vital parts of IMA.js - **object container** and **server-side rendering**.
In this smaller section of the tutorial, we're going to be processing input from user and
sending those data to the server.

## Processing input from user

To write new posts, we need to address several issues:

- **Notifying the controller** that the user submitted the new post.
- **Sending the post** to our server via HTTP (remember, we don't have
  an actual REST API backend, so we're going to mock this).
- **Waiting for our post** to be saved.
- **Showing the updated** list of posts.

We want the controller to handle submitting posts to the guest book in our
application instead of the `postingForm` component to **maintain a single
"source of truth"** in our application. This should be the case for all
information that is related to the page as a whole. **Local information** (for
example starting music playback when the user clicks the play button of some
player component) may remain stored within the component itself, as it is not
necessarily important to the overall state of the page.

We'll use another IMA.js service to notify the controller that the user
submitted a new post - the **EventBus**. In case you did not read [the details
about communication between the controller and the view](/tutorial/adding-some-state#notes-on-communication-between-controllers-and-views)
, the EventBus is an internal event system, built on top of DOM events, used for communication like this.

### Updating the form

First update the `<form ...` markup in the view of our `PostingForm` component
(`app/component/postingForm/PostingForm`) by adding an `onSubmit` event
listener:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```jsx
		<form action='' method='post' onSubmit={e => this._onSubmit(e)}>
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```tsx
		<form action='' method='post' onSubmit={e => this._onSubmit(e)}>
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then we need to hook our inputs to `_onChange()` handler which will set the contents of
those input to the state of our `PostingForm` component.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```jsx
		<input
			id='postForm-name'
			className='form-control'
			type='text'
			name='author'
			value={this.state.author}
			onChange={e => this._onChange(e)}
			placeholder='Your name'
		/>
		...
		<textarea
			id='postForm-content'
			className='form-control'
			name='content'
			value={this.state.content}
			onChange={e => this._onChange(e)}
			placeholder='What would you like to tell us?'
		/>
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```tsx
		<input
			id='postForm-name'
			className='form-control'
			type='text'
			name='author'
			value={this.state.author}
			onChange={e => this._onChange(e)}
			placeholder='Your name'
		/>
		...
		<textarea
			id='postForm-content'
			className='form-control'
			name='content'
			value={this.state.content}
			onChange={e => this._onChange(e)}
			placeholder='What would you like to tell us?'
		/>
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can't forget to define the default state for these two keys:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		#containerRef;

		constructor(props, context) {
			super(props, context);

			this.#containerRef = createRef();

			this.state = {
				author: '',
				content: '',
			};
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```tsx
		type Post = {
			author: string;
			content: string;
		};

		export class PostingForm extends AbstractComponent<{}, Post> {
			#containerRef: RefObject<HTMLDivElement>;

			constructor(props: Post, context: Context<PageContextType>) {
				super(props, context);
				this.#containerRef = createRef();

				this.state = {
					author: '',
					content: '',
				};
			}
			...
		}
		```

		> **TypeScript:** You need to also import `PageContextType` from '@ima/react-page-renderer'.

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Import the `createRef` from React to the
beginning of the file:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		import { createRef } from 'react';
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		import { RefObject, createRef, Context } from 'react';
		```

		> **TypeScript:** For Typescript we need to import some additional types.

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

...and add `ref={this.#containerRef}` to the first `div` in the component:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		...
		render() {
				return (
					<div className='posting-form card' ref={this.#containerRef}>
						<form action='' method='post' onSubmit={e => this._onSubmit(e)}>
							...
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```tsx
		...
		return (
			<div className='posting-form card' ref={this.#containerRef}>
				<form action='' method='post' onSubmit={e => this._onSubmit(e)}>
					...
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This adds some internal state to our form component, which we'll maintain
separately from the main page state maintained by the home page controller.

Now we need to define the `_onChange()` handler. We're going to use the
`name` attribute of input and textarea fields so both can be handled by defining only one method.
But feel free to define `onChange` handlers for each input separately, if that suits you better.
Our `_onChange()` handler will look like this:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		_onChange(event) {
			this.setState({
				[event.target.name]: event.target.value,
			});
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```tsx
		_onChange(event: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>) {
			this.setState({
				[event.target.name]: event.target.value,
			} as Pick<Post, keyof Post>);
		}
		```

		> **TypeScript: ** You need to import `ChangeEvent` from 'react'.
		We know that `event.target.name` is a key of our `Post` type, therefore we can cast it to `Pick<Post, keyof Post>` to avoid type errors.
		In real applications, we would make the typing better.

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The only thing that remains is to define the `_onSubmit()` in our component:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		_onSubmit(event) {
			event.preventDefault();

			this.fire(this.#containerRef.current, 'postSubmitted', {
				author: this.state.author,
				content: this.state.content,
			});

			// Reset the state after submitting
			this.setState({
				author: '',
				content: '',
			});
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript

		_onSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
			event.preventDefault();

			this.fire(this.#containerRef.current!, 'postSubmitted', {
				author: this.state.author,
				content: this.state.content,
			});

			// Reset the state after submitting
			this.setState({
				author: '',
				content: '',
			});
		}
		```

		> **TypeScript: ** You need to import `FormEvent` from 'react'.

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Firing EventBus events

We can **fire EventBus events** through `this.fire()` method that is available
to us by extending the `AbstractComponent`. So in this example
we fire the `postSubmitted` event through EventBus with the form data as
the event data, clear the form, and finally we prevent the browser from
submitting the form to the server.

The `this.fire()` method is a **short-hand** for `this.utils.$EventBus.fire(this, ...)`
call, which fires the custom DOM event using the EventBus. The `this.utils`
property is set to the view utils - various objects, data and services that
are useful for rendering the UI - and is obtained from the React context.
The value returned by `this.utils` is configurable in the
`app/config/bind.js` configuration file and is represented by the constant
`$Utils`.

### Capturing EventBus events

Now we need a way to capture the event in our home page controller, so open up
the home controller (the `app/page/home/HomeController.js` file) and add the
following method:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		onPostSubmitted(eventData) {
			// TODO
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		onPostSubmitted(eventData: PostData) {
			// TODO
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The IMA.js will automatically invoke this method when the `postSubmitted` event
bus event occurs. For details on how this mechanism works, please refer to the
[Emitting events using the EventBus](./adding-some-state#emitting-events-using-the-eventbus)
section of the third chapter of this tutorial.

Notice that our `onPostSubmitted()` event listener is a public method. This is
because it represents the (event) interface for the view components.

#### Updating our post service classes

Before we fill our `onPostSubmitted()` event listener with content however,
we need to update our post model classes first. Open the post factory class (`app/model/post/PostFactory.js`)
and add the following method for creating a single post:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		createEntity(entityData) {
			return new PostEntity(entityData);
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		createEntity(entityData: PostData): PostEntity {
			return new PostEntity(entityData);
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since we don't like to repeat ourselves, update the `return` statement in the
`createList()` method as well:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		return entities.map(entityData => this.createEntity(entityData));
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		return entities.map((entityData: PostData) => this.createEntity(entityData));
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now add the following method for creating new posts to the post resource
(`app/model/post/PostResource.js`):

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		createPost(postData) {
			return this._http
				.post('http://localhost:3001/static/static/public/posts.json', postData)
				.then(response => this._factory.createEntity(response.body));
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		type PostApiCreateResponse = {
			body: PostData;
		};

		export class PostResource {
			...

			createPost(postData: PostData): Promise<PostEntity> {
				return this._http
					.post('http://localhost:3001/static/static/public/posts.json', postData)
					.then((response: PostApiCreateResponse) =>
						this._factory.createEntity(response.body)
					);
			}
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This method accepts a plain object containing the new post data and submits
them to the server using an HTTP POST request. The `_http.post()` method sends
the HTTP POST request and returns a promise that resolves to the server's
response with the response body parsed as JSON. We then use the server's
response to create a post entity representing the saved post.

Next we need to create a method for creating posts in our post service
(`app/model/post/PostService.js`):

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		createPost(postData) {
			postData.id = null;
			return this._resource.createPost(postData);
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		import { PostData } from 'app/page/home/HomeController';

		export class PostService {
			...
			createPost(postData: PostData): Promise<PostEntity> {
				postData.id = null;
				return this._resource.createPost(postData);
			}
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This method sets the `id` field to `null` as it is expected for posts that were
not created yet (the post IDs should be generated by our backend) and uses the
post resource to create the post. The method returns a promise that resolves to
the post entity representing the created post.

#### Defining the `onPostSubmitted` method

With that in place, we can now fill in the contents of the `onPostSubmitted()`
event listener in the home page controller (`app/page/home/HomeController.js`):

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		this._postService
			.createPost(eventData)
			.then(() => this._postService.getPosts())
			.then(posts => this.setState({ posts }));
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		this._postService
			.createPost(eventData)
			.then(() => this._postService.getPosts())
			.then((posts: PostData[]) => this.setState({ posts }));
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This snippet calls the `createPost()` method with our event data, waits for the
post to be created, then requests the current list of posts from the post
service and updates the `posts` field in the view's state using the
`setState()` method. The `setState()` method updated only the fields of the
state that are present in the provided state object without modifying the rest,
and notifies the view about the new state so that the view is re-rendered.

### Updating the API

Now that everything is wired up, we can start submitting new posts, right?
Well, not so fast. Remember, we do not have an actual REST API backend, so the
HTTP POST request will fail and no new post will be created.

Since we don't want to implement an actual backend, we will work around this
issue by implementing a [mock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) **HTTP agent** that fetches the posts from the server and then acts as if sending
subsequent requests to the server while managing our state (the created posts)
locally and creating responses on spot without any actual communication with
the server. This approach is useful for both tests and our simple tutorial.

To create our HTTP mock create the `app/mock` directory and the
`app/mock/MockHttpAgent.js` () file with the following content:

```javascript
import { HttpAgentImpl } from '@ima/core';

const GET_DELAY = 70; // milliseconds
const POST_DELAY = 90; // milliseconds

export default class MockHttpAgent extends HttpAgentImpl {
  static get $dependencies() {
    return ['$HttpAgentProxy', '$Cache', '$CookieStorage', '$Settings.$Http'];
  }

  constructor(proxy, cache, cookie, config) {
    super(proxy, cache, cookie, config);

    this._posts = null;
  }

  get(url, data, options = {}) {
    if (!this._posts) {
      return super.get(url, data, options).then(response => {
        this._posts = response.body;

        return {
          body: this._posts.map(post => Object.assign({}, post)),
        };
      });
    }

    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve({
          body: this._posts.map(post => Object.assign({}, post)),
        });
      }, GET_DELAY);
    });
  }

  post(url, data, options = {}) {
    if (!this._posts) {
      return this.get(url, {}).then(() => this.post(url, data, options));
    }

    return new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        let clone = Object.assign({}, data);

        clone.id = this._posts[0].id + 1;
        this._posts.unshift(clone);

        resolve({
          body: Object.assign({}, clone),
        });
      }, POST_DELAY);
    });
  }
}
```

Let's take this class apart and take a look at what it does. We extend the
`ima/http/HttpAgent` class which is the HTTP agent provided by IMA.js, so
we need to obtain its dependencies in our constructor
(`proxy, cache, cookie, config`) and pass them to the super-constructor.

Next we set up the `_posts` field that we'll use to keep track of all posts and few REST API methods:

 - **The `get()` method** checks whether we already have the posts fetched from the
server, and, if we don't, it uses the super-implementation to fetch them and
store them in the `_posts` field. If the posts have already been fetched, the
method returns a promise that resolves to a clone of the posts after the
configured delay.

 - **The `post()` method** checks whether we already have the posts fetched from the
server, and, if we don't, it fetches them using the `get()` method and then
calls itself again. If we already have the posts fetched, the method clones the
data passed to it in parameters, generates an ID, stores the new record as the
first element of the `_posts` array while shifting the rest of the posts and
resolves the returned promise after the configured delay to the stored post.

We included the delays in our `get()` and `post()` methods to simulate the
latency imposed by a real networking. Also notice how we always clone the data
we receive before storing them internally and return only clones of our
internal posts storage. This is to emulate the server behavior reliably, so
that new posts won't modify previously returned post arrays and later
modifications of data passed to or received from our mock server won't modify
the internal state or data returned by other calls to our methods.

To wire up our HTTP mock into our application, we need to update the dependencies of the `app/model/post/PostResource.js`:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

		```javascript
		import PostFactory from './PostFactory';
		import MockHttpAgent from 'app/mock/MockHttpAgent';

		export default class PostResource {
			static get $dependencies() {
				return [MockHttpAgent, PostFactory];
			}

			...
		}
		```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

		```typescript
		import MockHttpAgent from 'app/mock/MockHttpAgent';

		export class PostResource {
			// @ts-expect-error
			static $dependencies: Dependencies = [MockHttpAgent, PostFactory];

			declare _http: MockHttpAgent;
			...
			constructor(http: MockHttpAgent, factory: PostFactory) {
				...
			}
			...
		}
		```
		> **TypeScript:** Because we are using only mock HttpAgent, we won't bother with proper typing.

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Go ahead and check the result in the browser, you will now be able to write new
posts to our guestbook (which will disappear once you reload the page, since we
keep the posts only in our HTTP mock).
