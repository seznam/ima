import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In [previous section](/tutorial/static-view) of the tutorial, we prepared basic markup and custom styling
thanks to the [Bootstrap CSS library](https://getbootstrap.com/).
In this section, we're going to add some functionality to our application.

## Controller & error handling

Our guestbook may look nice, but it is kind of boring since the posts are static
and we cannot add new posts. So let's take care of this.

To begin, we'll render posts from data that we'll store as the state of our page
controller. Open the `app/page/home/HomeController.js` file and you'll see a class declaration.


You can notice that by default, our bootstrapped application includes some pre-defined
methods along with very long JSDoc comments. Feel free to read through these comments
but to make this tutorial simpler, we're going to replace contents of this file with following code:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import { AbstractController } from '@ima/core';

export class HomeController extends AbstractController {
	static get $dependencies() {
		return [];
	}

	constructor() {
		super();
	}

	load() {
		return {};
	}

	setMetaParams(loadedResources, metaManager, router, dictionary, settings) {
		metaManager.setTitle('Guestbook');
	}
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript
import {
	AbstractController,
	Dependencies,
	Dictionary,
	LoadedResources,
	MetaManager,
	Router,
	Settings,
} from '@ima/core';

export type PostData = {
	content: string;
	author: string;
};
export type HomeControllerState = {
	posts: PostData[];
};

export class HomeController extends AbstractController<HomeControllerState> {
	static $dependencies: Dependencies = [];

	constructor() {
		super();
	}

	load(): HomeControllerState {
		return {};
	}

	setMetaParams(
		loadedResources: LoadedResources<HomeControllerState>,
		metaManager: MetaManager,
		router: Router,
		dictionary: Dictionary,
		settings: Settings
	): void {
		metaManager.setTitle('Guestbook');
	}
}
```

> **TypeScript:** As you can see, the TypeScript code is a lot more complex.
		The main reason is adding types `PostData` and `HomeControllerState` that we will use later in this course.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `AbstractController` class defines some methods which are executed
in different parts of it's lifecycle, you can [read more about this in the documentation](../basic-features/controller-lifecycle.md)
One of the main methods you're going to use frequently is the `load()` method.

The `load()` method is called automatically
by IMA.js when the controller is being initialized. It returns a hash object - a plain
JavaScript object representing a map of keys and values - representing the initial
state of the page. The values in the returned object may be
[promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or scalar values.
The IMA.js will wait for all promises to resolve before rendering the page,
allowing us to fetch any data we may need from the server.

Once all promises are resolved, IMA.js sets the controller's view state to the
hash object with promises replaced by the values the promises resolved to.

In case that a promise gets rejected, we may want to display a specific error
page. It is recommended to reject the load promises using IMA.js'
`GenericError` (located in the module `@ima/error/GenericError`), which
allows you to specify the HTTP status code representing the error type,
resulting in the appropriate error page being displayed. An example usage
of the `load()` method is show below:

```javascript
load() {
  return {
    ourPageData: fetchUsefulData(params).catch((error) => {
      // Note: the fetchUsefulData() should already return a promise
      // rejected by GenericError in case an error occurs, so we would not
      // have to do this in our every controller using a function like
      // this one.

      if (error.name === 'NotFoundError') {
        throw new GenericError('No such records exist', {
          cause: error,
          params: params,
          status: 404 // The 404 HTTP status stands for "Not Found"
        });
      } else {
        throw new GenericError('Cannot retrieve data', {
          cause: error,
          params: params,
          status: 500 // The 500 HTTP status stands for "Internal Server Error"
        });
      }
    })
  };
}
```

Now you may be tempted to simply extend the native `Error` class (or one of its
siblings). The problem with that is that all browsers do not generate stack
traces for custom errors extending the native ones (unless you are using a
browser that has already implemented error sub-classing). The `GenericError`
takes care of this for us and also allows you
to create custom error classes by extending the `GenericError` class while still
having access to stack traces of your errors.

## Fetching posts

But let's refocus on the `load()` method in our controller. For now, we'll
specify our data statically and take care of fetching the data from the server in
a later point in this tutorial. Replace the contents of the `load()` method with
the following code:

```javascript
return {
  posts: [
    {
      content: 'Never mistake motion for action.',
      author: 'Ernest Hemingway',
    },
    {
      content: 'Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.',
      author: 'Henry Ford',
    },
    {
      content:
        'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.',
      author: 'Aristotle',
    },
    {
      content:
        'Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.',
      author: 'Albert Einstein',
    }
  ]
};
```

As you may have noticed, we used JSON-compatible code in case of `posts` - this
will come in handy later when we'll introduce fetching the data from the
server and move the structure to an external JSON file.

### Splitting the render method

Let's return to our view in the `app/page/home/HomeView.jsx` file. Replace the
`render()` method with the following code snippet:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```jsx
render() {
	return (
		<div className='l-home container'>
			<h1>Guestbook</h1>
			<div className='posting-form card'>
				<form action='' method='post'>
					<h5 className='card-header'>Add a post</h5>
					<div className='card-body'>
						<div className='form-group'>
							<label htmlFor='postForm-name'>Name:</label>
							<input
								id='postForm-name'
								className='form-control'
								type='text'
								name='author'
								placeholder='Your name'
							/>
						</div>
						<div className='form-group'>
							<label htmlFor='postForm-content'>Post:</label>
							<textarea
								id='postForm-content'
								className='form-control'
								name='content'
								placeholder='What would you like to tell us?'
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div className='card-footer'>
						<button type='submit' className='btn btn btn-outline-primary'>
							Submit
							<div className='ripple-wrapper' />
						</button>
					</div>
				</form>
			</div>
			<hr />
			<div className='posts'>
				<h2>Posts</h2>
				{this._renderPosts()}
			</div>
		</div>
	);
}

_renderPosts() {
	const { posts } = this.props;

	return posts.map((post, index) => (
		<div className='post card card-default' key={index}>
			<div className='card-body'>{post.content}</div>
			<div className='post-author card-footer'>{post.author}</div>
		</div>
	));
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```tsx
import { PageContext, AbstractComponent } from '@ima/react-page-renderer';
import { PostData } from 'app/page/home/HomeController';
import './homeView.less';

type HomeViewProps = {
	posts: PostData[];
};

export class HomeView extends AbstractComponent<{ posts: PostData[] }> {
	static get contextType() {
		return PageContext;
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div className='l-home container'>
				<h1>Guestbook</h1>
				<div className='posting-form card'>
					<form action='' method='post'>
						<h5 className='card-header'>Add a post</h5>
						<div className='card-body'>
							<div className='form-group'>
								<label htmlFor='postForm-name'>Name:</label>
									<input
									id='postForm-name'
									className='form-control'
									type='text'
									name='author'
									placeholder='Your name'
									/>
							</div>
							<div className='form-group'>
								<label htmlFor='postForm-content'>Post:</label>
								<textarea
								id='postForm-content'
								className='form-control'
								name='content'
								placeholder='What would you like to tell us?'
								/>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div className='card-footer'>
							<button type='submit' className='btn btn btn-outline-primary'>
								Submit
								<div className='ripple-wrapper' />
							</button>
						</div>
					</form>
				</div>
				<hr />
				<div className='posts'>
					<h2>Posts</h2>
					{this._renderPosts()}
				</div>
			</div>
		);
	}

	_renderPosts() {
		const { posts } = this.props;

		return posts.map((post, index) => (
			<div className='post card card-default' key={index}>
				<div className='card-body'>{post.content}</div>
				<div className='post-author card-footer'>{post.author}</div>
			</div>
		));
	}
}
```

> **TypeScript: ** New type `HomeViewProps` has been used to correctly accept typed props in our `HomeView`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We have replaced the old sequence of
`<div className='post card card-default'>` tags with the
`{this._renderPosts()}` expression, which tells React to insert the return
value of our new `_renderPosts()` method.

The `_renderPosts()` method traverses the array of posts available as
`this.props.posts` (`this.props` refers to the page controller's state in
page views) and creates a new array containing the rendered posts. Notice
that we are using `props` instead of `state` in our view because we are
referencing external data, not the internal state of our view component.

The structure of the UI representing a post has had its static content
replaced with the `{post.content}` and `{post.author}` expressions injecting
the content and the author of the post, and we have added a new `key={index}`
attribute (technically, it is a React element property, but we'll use the XML
terminology in this tutorial). The `key` attribute is required by React to help
it identify parts of the DOM, therefore its value must be unique within the
context and represent a relationship between the DOM fragment and the data.
Here we set it to the index of the current post in the `posts` array.

In practice you should not use array indexes as keys because shifting or
modifying the contents of the array will result in using the same keys for
different items in each rendering, which will result in a strange and quirky
behavior, especially for components with their own state. It is best to use
unique identifiers, such as the primary key of the record provided by the
database.

Since we do not have the posts stored in an actual database, we're going to
help ourselves in a different way, but we'll address that later in this
tutorial.

## Creating new components

Now the view looks better, but it's still not perfect, because the view still
feels bulky. To fix that, we start by moving the post rendering to a new
component.

Create the `app/component/post` directory and the `app/component/post/Post.jsx` (or `Post.tsx` if follow typescript version of the tutorial)
and `app/component/post/post.less` files.

Put the following code into the `Post.jsx` (or `Post.tsx`) file:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="JavaScript">

```jsx
import { AbstractComponent } from '@ima/react-page-renderer';
import './post.less';

export default class Post extends AbstractComponent {
	render() {
		const { content, author } = this.props;

		return (
			<div className='post card card-default'>
				<div className='card-body'>{content}</div>
				<div className='post-author card-footer'>{author}</div>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```tsx
import { AbstractComponent } from '@ima/react-page-renderer';
import './post.less';

type PostProps = {
	content: string;
	author: string;
};

export class Post extends AbstractComponent<PostProps> {
	render() {
		const { content, author } = this.props;

		return (
			<div className='post card card-default'>
			<div className='card-body'>{content}</div>
			<div className='post-author card-footer'>{author}</div>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>


In this component we access the post content and author name in our `render()`
method using the `this.props` object, which contains a hash object of
properties passed to the React component by whatever code is using it.

To use our new component, we need to update the `_renderPosts()` method in the
`app/page/home/HomeView.jsx` file to the following code:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```jsx
return posts.map((post, index) => (
	<Post key={index} content={post.content} author={post.author} />
));
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```tsx
return posts.map((post: PostData, index) => (
	<Post key={index} content={post.content} author={post.author} />
));
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

...and import the `Post` component by adding the following import to the
beginning of the file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import Post from 'app/component/post/Post';
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript
import { Post } from 'app/component/post/Post';
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> **Note**: You can notice that so far we **haven't used relative imports** when importing
our custom JS modules from inside of the app directory structure. This is
because IMA.js adds the `app` directory to the **lookup path**. This means that
you can refer to any file inside `app` directory through an absolute path,
which makes most of the imports much cleaner.

To finish the creation of the post component, we need to move the related
styles from `app/page/home/homeView.less` to `app/component/post/post.less`.
Move the following code to the `post.less` file:

```scss
.post-author {
  text-align: @post-author-alignment;
  font-style: italic;
  font-size: 85%;
}
```

We can further improve our page view structure by refactoring-out the
"new post" form to a separate component. Create the `app/component/postingForm`
directory and the `app/component/postingForm/PostingForm.jsx` (or `PostingForm.tsx`) file. Then, put the
following code into the newly created file:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```jsx
import { AbstractComponent } from '@ima/react-page-renderer';
import React from 'react';

export default class PostingForm extends AbstractComponent {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className='posting-form card'>
				<form action='' method='post'>
					<h5 className='card-header'>Add a post</h5>
					<div className='card-body'>
						<div className='form-group'>
							<label htmlFor='postForm-name'>Name:</label>
							<input
								id='postForm-name'
								className='form-control'
								type='text'
								name='author'
								placeholder='Your name'
							/>
						</div>
						<div className='form-group'>
							<label htmlFor='postForm-content'>Post:</label>
							<textarea
								id='postForm-content'
								className='form-control'
								name='content'
								placeholder='What would you like to tell us?'
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div className='card-footer'>
						<button type='submit' className='btn btn btn-outline-primary'>
							Submit
							<div className='ripple-wrapper' />
						</button>
					</div>
				</form>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```tsx
export default class PostingForm extends AbstractComponent  {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className='posting-form card'>
				<form action='' method='post'>
					<h5 className='card-header'>Add a post</h5>
					<div className='card-body'>
						<div className='form-group'>
							<label htmlFor='postForm-name'>Name:</label>
							<input
							id='postForm-name'
							className='form-control'
							type='text'
							name='author'
							placeholder='Your name'
							/>
						</div>
						<div className='form-group'>
							<label htmlFor='postForm-content'>Post:</label>
							<textarea
							id='postForm-content'
							className='form-control'
							name='content'
							placeholder='What would you like to tell us?'
							/>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div className='card-footer'>
						<button type='submit' className='btn btn btn-outline-primary'>
							Submit
							<div className='ripple-wrapper' />
						</button>
					</div>
				</form>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Nothing new here, we just extracted the code from home controller's view and
put it into a new React component.

Now update the `render()` method in the home controller's view:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```jsx
return (
	<div className='l-home container'>
		<h1>Guestbook</h1>
		<PostingForm />

		<hr />

		<div className='posts'>
			<h2>Posts</h2>
			{this._renderPosts()}
		</div>
	</div>
);
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```tsx
return (
	<div className='l-home container'>
		<h1>Guestbook</h1>
		<PostingForm />

		<hr />

		<div className='posts'>
			<h2>Posts</h2>
			{this._renderPosts()}
		</div>
	</div>
);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To finish up, import the posting form component:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="JavaScript">

```javascript
import PostingForm from 'app/component/postingForm/PostingForm';
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript">

```tsx
import { PostingForm } from 'app/component/postingForm/PostingForm';
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


So far we've been **only refactoring our code and moving few bits around** to make it cleaner.
When you refresh the page, you should see the same page as you ended up with after the end of
the previous tutorial.

Now that our code looks much cleaner, we can look into fetching the guestbook
posts from the server. However, if you'd like to linger a little longer and
learn more how the controller and view communicate by passing state, check out
the following optional section [Notes on communication between controllers and
views](#notes-on-communication-between-controllers-and-views).

## Notes on communication between controllers and views

There are three ways the controllers and views communicate:

1. **By passing state from the controller to the view &ndash;** this is the most
    common way of passing information.
2. **By emitting DOM events** from the view and listening for them in the controller
    or parent components (using the `EventBus`) &ndash; this is
    the most common way of notifying the controller or a parent UI component of
    the user's actions in the view.
3. **By emitting "global" events** in the controller and / or view and listening for
    them in the controller and / or view (using the `Dispatcher`)
    &ndash; this is used only in very specific situations, like when the UI
    needs to be notified about an external event captured by the controller and
    updating the state is not practical.

### Passing state

The controller creates the initial state of the page by returning a hash object
of values and promises from its `load()` method. The IMA.js then waits for all
the promises to resolve at the server, pass the resulting values as properties
to the page view component, and renders the page to send it to the client.

The situation is a little more complicated at the client-side however. When the
page is being "re-animated" after being rendered at the server-side, the IMA.js
uses the controller's `load()` method and the returned object in the same way,
though the promises are usually resolved immediately using the data in the
cache sent to the client along with the rendered page.

When the user navigates between pages, however, the IMA.js does not wait for
all promises to resolve before rendering the new view. The IMA.js registers
callbacks on all returned promises, and whenever one of the promises resolves,
IMA.js pushes the currently resolved fragment of the page state to the view.

On one hand, this allows you to display content as it loads (providing it is
decoupled) while displaying loading indicators where the content is not
available yet. On the other hand, this does require you to add more logic to
your view, checking whether the data is available or not, and displaying
loading indicators where the data is not available yet.

### Emitting events using the EventBus

The `EventBus` API allows your UI components to emit custom DOM
events that naturally propagate through the DOM tree representing the tree of
your UI components.

This is usually used to notify the parent components of user interaction with
custom controls in your UI, or to notify the page controller itself.

The custom events may have any name and carry arbitrary data that are not
restricted to JSON-serializable values.

Furthermore, the controllers can easily listen for the events dispatched using
the EventBus (unless the propagation of the event is stopped by a component
half the way) by declaring event listener methods.

An event listener method is a method of a controller named by the first-letter
capitalized event name with the `on` prefix, for example the `formSubmitted`
event can be listened for by defining the `onFormSubmitted()` method on your
controller.

The first argument passed into the controller's event listener method will be
the event data, not the event object itself, as manipulating the event object
once it reaches the controller is pointless.

### Emitting events using the Dispatcher

The obvious limitation of the `EventBus` API is that it only allows
to create events that propagate up the tree of the UI components. The common
way to propagate event in other directions, or to other parts of the UI, or
from the controller to the UI is using the `Dispatcher` API.

The Dispatcher allows any UI component and controller to register and
deregister event listeners for arbitrarily named events and fire these events
with arbitrary data.

The events propagate directly to the registered event listeners with no way to
stop their propagation.

Note that events distributed using the Dispatcher are useful only in very
specific use-cases, so the Dispatcher logs a warning to the console if there
are no listeners registered for the fired event in order to notify you of
possible typos in event names.

As always, you can learn more about `EventBus` and `Dispatcher` [in the documentation](../basic-features/events.md)
