   * At the server, the method first waits for all the resources to load, and
   * then renders the page to a string containing HTML markup to send to the
   * client.
   *
   * At the client, the method uses the already available resources to render
   * the page into DOM, re-using the DOM created from the HTML markup send by
   * the server if possible. After this the method will re-render the page
   * every time another resource being loaded finishes its loading and
   * becomes available.
   *
   * Note that the method renders the page at the client-side only after all
   * resources have been loaded if this is the first time this method is
   * invoked at the client.
   *
   * @param controller The current page controller.
   * @param view The page's view.
   * @param pageResources The resources for
   *        the view loaded by the controller.
