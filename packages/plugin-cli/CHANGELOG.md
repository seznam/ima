# Change Log

## 19.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 7e6a4de65: Fix link not working on linux environments in some edge cases

## 19.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba937c138: Fix bug in createBatcher function in utils.ts, which resulted in link not working

## 19.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 0a95f11e6: Hotfix error exit on build command

## 19.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 508c532f5: - `typescriptDeclarationsPlugin` now accepts optional `tsConfigPath`, which allows you to specify a custom path to your `tsconfig.json` file.
  - `typescriptDeclarationsPlugin` now by default tries to resolve `tsconfig.build.json` before `tsconfig.json`, if it exists.
  - `typescriptDeclarationsPlugin` can now trigger `exit 1` when types are not correctly generated, instead of silently ignoring the error. This can be enabled by setting `allowFailure` to `true`.
  - All FS operations in `dev` and `link` mode are now batched with a debounce of 150ms, which should improve performance when working with a large number of files. The output is also batched and simplified, which should significantly reduce the output noise.

## 19.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 7bcbf6d71: Changed default tsconfig to isolated modules, which required some export adjustments

## 19.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a6b996d4: All swc transformations now produce source map files alongside transformed files.
- 5380e516e: When parsing configuration file the plugin now searches for ima-plugin.config.js files recursively up to filesystem root. This allows to have one custom config file for monorepositories and removes the need of duplicating same config across all package directories
- 168fa6d6a: Added ability to enable/disable soure maps generation using `sourceMaps` option in `ima-plugin.config.js` configuration file.
  Added ability to add new custom transformers using `transformers` option in `ima-plugin.config.js` configuration file.
