# Change Log

## 18.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4342d6e60: Add support for `ImaPluginConfig.output.exclude`, which works just like inverted `include`

### Patch Changes

- 4342d6e60: Updated `defaultConfig` and `clientServerConfig` to bundle less/css files into seperate directory in dist and all other assets are now bundled into each bundle version (esm/cjs/client/server). This fixes an issue, where some essential json files were not available in the cjs bundle.

## 18.0.0

### Major Changes

- 91c4c409: Renamed `BuildConfig` type to `ImaPluginConfig`
  Better output for build command
  Added new optional `name` argument to `ImaPluginConfig` (default preset configuration set this to output module type but can be anything you want). This is used only in the output commands.
- 91c4c409: Plugin config now has completely different configuration definition
  Link, dev and build commands are now more efficient and use less watchers for multiple bundle options
  Transformers option is now deprecated (they are part of the core replaced with type and bundle option)
  New CLI argument --clientServerConfig
